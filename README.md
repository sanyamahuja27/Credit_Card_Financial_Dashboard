Credit Card Transaction and Customer Dashboard using Power BI

Project Objective : To develop a comprehensive credit card weekly dashboard that provides real-time insights into key performance metrics and trends, enabling stakeholders to monitor and analyze credit card operations effectively.

Steps Taken: I leveraged DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to enhance data insights and reporting. Here’s a snapshot of what I accomplished:

🔍 Customer Segmentation:

• AgeGroup: Categorized customers into age brackets (e.g., "20-30", "30-40") to better understand demographics.

• IncomeGroup: Grouped customers into income categories (e.g., "Low", "Med", "High") to analyze economic segments.

📅 Revenue Analysis:

Revenue Calculation: Summed up key revenue components including annual fees, transaction amounts, and interest earned.

Weekly Revenue Trends: Developed measures to track and compare current week revenue against the previous week for trend analysis.

These DAX queries provided deeper insights into customer behavior and financial performance, enabling more informed decision-making.
